# Day 8 Task: Basic Git & GitHub for DevOps Engineers.

## What is Git?

1. Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes to
   their code over time, collaborate with others on projects, and manage
   different versions of their code. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005,
   while he was developing the Linux operating system.

2. Git uses a distributed architecture, which means that each developer has
   their own local copy of the entire repository, including all the files and
   the complete history of changes.

## What is Github?

Cloud-based version control systems such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab
offer a convenient and powerful way for developers to manage their code and
collaborate on projects.

`GitHub` is the largest and most popular of these platforms, with
millions of users and repositories. It provides a range of features
including code review, issue tracking, and continuous integration, as well
as integrations with a wide range of other development tools.

## What is Version Control? How many types of version controls we have?

Version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the
process of managing changes to documents, code, or any other set of files over
time. It is commonly used in software development to keep track of changes to
source code but can be used for any type of file that undergoes changes over
time.
In version control, every change made to a file is tracked and stored, along
with information such as who made the change and when it was made. This
allows users to access previous versions of the file, compare changes between
versions, and revert to a previous version if necessary

1. Local Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools that enable
   developers to track changes to their code files locally on their own
   computer. These systems are typically used by individual developers in a
   shared file system, and they provide a way to keep track of changes
   made to the code over time

2. A centralized version control system (VCS) is a software tool that allows
   developers to track changes to their code files and collaborate with
   others in a centralized location. In a centralized VCS, all code files and
   their versions are stored on a central server, and developers can access
   and modify them from their local machines.

3. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) are software tools that
   enable developers to track changes to their code files and collaborate
   with others in a decentralized way. In a DVCS, each developer has their
   own copy of the entire code repository, including all previous versions
   and branches, which they can work on independently.

## Why we use distributed version control over centralized version control?

1. Decentralized collaboration: In a DVCS, each developer has their
   own copy of the code repository, which enables them to work
   independently and collaborate with others without relying on a
   central server.
2. Branching and merging: DVCS tools like Git make it easy to create
   and manage branches, experiment with new features, and merge
   changes back into the main codebase.
3. Offline capabilities: Because developers have a local copy of the
   entire repository, they can work offline and synchronize changes
   later when they are connected to the network.
4. Security and redundancy: Because each developer has a copy of
   the code repository, there is no single point of failure or
   vulnerability. This can help to improve security and redundancy in
   case of data loss or other disasters.
